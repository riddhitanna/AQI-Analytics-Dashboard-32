# AQI Watch

This is the repository for the course project of the course IT314 Software Engineering offered by DA-IICT and made under the guidance of Prof. Saurabh Tiwari. Our objective was to design a platform which collects toxic substance data and allows users easy access to their overall exposure levels of pollutants. Users can see the further breakdown of the quality of air around them through seamlessly integrated visualizations and other statistical data. This project will help people be more aware of the exposure they have to pollutants around them, and in turn help them make better decisions about which areas to avoid.
